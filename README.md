## Prerequisites
1. Linux (Ubuntu).
1. [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

**NOTE**
You will need to be able to run docker commands without sudo to run this tutorial. Use the following commands to do this.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

The tutorial was developed on an [Azure Ubuntu
DSVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro),
which addresses the first three prerequisites.

## Setup

To set up your environment to run these notebooks, please follow these steps.  They setup the notebooks to use Azure seamlessly.

1. Create a _Linux_ _Ubuntu_ VM.
1. Copy `sample_workspace_conf.yml` to a new file, `workspace_conf.yml`, and fill in each field. This will keep secrets out of the source code, and this file will be ignored by git.
1. Log in to your VM.  We recommend that you use a graphical client
   such as
   [X2Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro#x2go)
   to access your VM.  The remaining steps are to be done on the VM.
1. Open a terminal emulator.
1. Clone, fork, or download the zip file for this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/ai-architecture-template.git
   ```
1. Enter the local repository:
   ```
   cd ai-architecture-template
   ```
1. Create the Python ai-architecture-template virtual environment using the environment.yml:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source activate ai-architecture-template
   ```
   The remaining steps should be done in this virtual environment.
1. Login to Azure:
   ```
   az login
   ```
   You can verify that you are logged in to your subscription by executing
   the command:
   ```
   az account show -o table
   ```
1. If you have more than one Azure subscription, select it:
   ```
   az account set --subscription <Your Azure Subscription>
   ```
1. Start the Jupyter notebook server:
	```
	jupyter notebook
